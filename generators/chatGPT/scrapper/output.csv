"Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations of vector bosons","The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is a thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in 1935 to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. It involves two particles that are entangled and separated by a large distance. The EPR paradox suggests that the state of one particle can influence the state of the other particle instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon, known as non-local behavior, has been experimentally verified using various types of particles, including vector bosons. In this paper, we review the concept of EPR correlations and discuss their observation in vector bosons.","Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory of nature that describes the behavior of small particles, such as atoms and subatomic particles. One of the key principles of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, cannot be measured precisely at the same time. Another important concept in quantum mechanics is entanglement, which refers to the phenomenon of two particles becoming correlated in such a way that measuring the state of one particle affects the state of the other particle, even if they are separated by a large distance.

The EPR paradox was proposed as a way to challenge the completeness of quantum mechanics. In the EPR paradox, two particles are entangled and separated by a large distance. The paradox suggests that the state of one particle can influence the state of the other particle instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon, known as non-local behavior, has been experimentally verified using various types of particles, including vector bosons.

Vector bosons are subatomic particles that mediate the fundamental forces of nature, such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force. They are characterized by their spin, which can be either zero or one. Vector bosons are considered to be ideal candidates for studying EPR correlations because they have a spin of one and can be entangled easily.","The EPR paradox is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that has been experimentally verified using various types of particles, including vector bosons. The non-local behavior observed in EPR correlations challenges the completeness of quantum mechanics and has implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe. Further research on EPR correlations in vector bosons may shed light on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and our understanding of the nature of reality."
"Fast k-Nearest Neighbour Search via Prioritized DCI","The k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) search is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition and machine learning. It involves finding the k nearest points to a given query point in a dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for fast k-NN search called Prioritized DCI. Our method utilizes the idea of divide and conquer, which involves dividing the dataset into smaller chunks and searching for the nearest neighbours in each chunk in a prioritized manner. We demonstrate through experimental evaluation that our method outperforms state-of-the-art k-NN search algorithms in terms of both accuracy and speed.","The k-NN search problem has a wide range of applications, including image classification, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection. It is essential to have fast and accurate k-NN search algorithms in order to handle large datasets and real-time applications. However, traditional k-NN search algorithms such as linear search and k-d tree have time complexities that scale poorly with the size of the dataset.

To address this issue, we propose a novel k-NN search algorithm called Prioritized DCI. Our method utilizes the divide and conquer approach, which involves dividing the dataset into smaller chunks and searching for the nearest neighbours in each chunk in a prioritized manner. The prioritization is based on the distance of the chunk's centroid to the query point. This allows us to significantly reduce the search space and achieve faster search times compared to traditional methods.","In this paper, we have presented a fast k-NN search algorithm called Prioritized DCI.

"Structure and stability of graphene nanoribbons in oxygen, carbon  dioxide, water, and ammonia","Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are a promising material for various applications due to their unique electronic and mechanical properties. However, the stability of GNRs in different environments is crucial for their practical use. In this study, we investigate the structure and stability of GNRs in oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results show that GNRs are stable in all four environments, with only minor changes in their structural parameters. However, the presence of oxygen and water leads to the formation of oxygen and hydroxyl groups on the GNR surface, respectively, which may affect their electronic properties. On the other hand, the interaction of GNRs with ammonia leads to the formation of nitrogen-doped GNRs, which may have potential applications as a catalyst. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stability of GNRs in different environments and may pave the way for their practical use in various applications.","Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its unique electronic and mechanical properties. One of the key features of graphene is its high carrier mobility, making it a promising material for use in electronic devices such as transistors and solar cells. However, the zero bandgap of graphene limits its practical use in certain applications.

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are narrow strips of graphene that have a finite width and a well-defined bandgap, making them attractive for use in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The bandgap of GNRs depends on their width and edge structure, and can be tuned by varying these parameters. In addition, GNRs have excellent mechanical strength and can withstand high stresses, making them suitable for use in structural materials.

Despite their potential applications, the stability of GNRs in different environments is crucial for their practical use. In this study, we investigate the structure and stability of GNRs in oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our aim is to understand the effect of these environments on the structural and electronic properties of GNRs and to assess their potential for use in different applications.","In conclusion, we have investigated the structure and stability of graphene nanoribbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia using DFT calculations.

"Efficient Wiener filtering without preconditioning","Wiener filtering is a well-known technique for signal restoration in the presence of additive noise. However, traditional methods for implementing Wiener filtering often require the computation of large matrix inverses, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach for efficiently implementing Wiener filtering without the need for preconditioning. Our method is based on the iterative solution of the Wiener filtering equation using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and show that it can provide significant computational savings compared to traditional methods.","Wiener filtering is a method for estimating the original signal, x, given a noisy observation, y, and a known noise model. It is based on the principle of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the estimate, x̂, and the original signal. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

argmin_{x̂} MSE(x̂, x) = argmin_{x̂} ||y - x̂||^2 + ||x̂ - x||^2

The first term on the right hand side represents the error between the estimate and the observation, and the second term represents the error between the estimate and the original signal. The Wiener filter can be derived by setting the derivative of the MSE with respect to x̂ to zero and solving for x̂. This results in the following equation:

x̂ = (H^TH + R^-1)^-1 H^Ty

where H is the transfer function of the system, and R is the noise covariance matrix.

Traditionally, the Wiener filter has been implemented by first computing the matrix inverse of (H^TH + R^-1), and then multiplying it by H^T and y. However, this requires the computation of a large matrix inverse, which can be computationally expensive. In addition, the matrix inverse can be unstable, particularly when the condition number of (H^TH + R^-1) is high.","In this paper, we have presented a novel approach for efficiently implementing Wiener filtering without the need for preconditioning. Our method is based on the iterative solution of the Wiener filtering equation using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and shown that it can provide significant computational savings compared to traditional methods. Overall, our approach offers a practical and efficient solution for implementing Wiener filtering in a variety of signal processing applications."
"Nonparametric Analysis of Delayed Treatment Effects using  Single-Crossing Constraints","Delayed treatment effects are an important consideration in many fields, including economics and public policy. However, analyzing these effects can be challenging due to the lack of parametric assumptions about the underlying data generating process. In this paper, we propose the use of nonparametric methods and single-crossing constraints to estimate the treatment effect in the presence of delayed treatment effects. Our approach allows for the estimation of the treatment effect at any point in time, rather than just at the end of the study period, and can be applied to both continuous and discrete outcomes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation studies and an empirical application to a real-world data set.","Delayed treatment effects occur when the impact of a treatment is not realized until some time after the treatment has been administered. This can be due to a variety of factors, including the need for the treatment to accumulate in the body or for behavioral changes to occur. Delayed treatment effects are commonly observed in fields such as economics and public policy, where interventions are designed to have long-term impacts on outcomes such as education and health.

Estimating the treatment effect in the presence of delayed treatment effects can be challenging due to the lack of parametric assumptions about the underlying data generating process. Traditional methods, such as randomized controlled trials and difference-in-differences models, rely on assumptions about the functional form of the treatment effect over time. These assumptions may not hold in the presence of delayed treatment effects, leading to biased estimates.

To address this issue, nonparametric methods have been proposed as an alternative approach to estimating treatment effects in the presence of delayed treatment effects. Nonparametric methods do not rely on parametric assumptions about the functional form of the treatment effect and can therefore provide more accurate estimates.

One nonparametric method that has been proposed for estimating treatment effects with delayed treatment effects is the use of single-crossing constraints. Single-crossing constraints are a set of conditions that restrict the functional form of the treatment effect over time. These constraints can be used to identify the treatment effect at any point in time, rather than just at the end of the study period.

In this paper, we propose the use of nonparametric methods and single-crossing constraints to estimate the treatment effect in the presence of delayed treatment effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation studies and an empirical application to a real-world data set.","In this paper, we have presented a method for estimating the treatment effect in the presence of delayed treatment effects using nonparametric methods and single-crossing constraints.

"The Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton: Mass Assembly and  Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation. I. Programme overview","The Cluster HEritage project is a multi-wavelength study of galaxy clusters using the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. The goal of the project is to understand the role of galaxy clusters in the process of structure formation and the evolution of the universe. The project will focus on the mass assembly and thermodynamics of galaxy clusters at the endpoint of structure formation, using a sample of over 100 clusters. The project will also investigate the relationship between the properties of the intracluster medium and the properties of the galaxy population within the cluster.","Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe and are thought to play a significant role in the process of structure formation. The intracluster medium (ICM) within galaxy clusters is a hot, diffuse gas that is rich in heavy elements and provides an important source of energy for the evolution of the cluster. The ICM is also thought to be a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution within the cluster.

The XMM-Newton X-ray telescope is a powerful tool for studying the ICM, as it is sensitive to the thermal X-ray emission from the hot gas. The Cluster HEritage project will use XMM-Newton to study a sample of over 100 galaxy clusters, focusing on the mass assembly and thermodynamics of the clusters at the endpoint of structure formation. By combining X-ray data with data from other wavelengths, such as optical, radio, and microwave, the project will investigate the relationship between the properties of the ICM and the properties of the galaxy population within the cluster.","The Cluster HEritage project is a comprehensive study of galaxy clusters that will provide important insights into the role of these structures in the process of structure formation and the evolution of the universe.

"Symmetry-broken momentum distributions induced by matter-wave  diffraction during time-of-flight expansion of ultracold atoms","In this study, we demonstrate that matter-wave diffraction during the time-of-flight expansion of ultracold atoms can lead to symmetry-broken momentum distributions. By controlling the initial state of the ultracold atoms and the expansion geometry, we are able to induce asymmetry in the momentum distribution, which would not be present in the absence of diffraction. Our results provide a new method for manipulating the momentum distribution of ultracold atoms and could have applications in precision measurement and quantum simulations.","Ultracold atoms, typically with temperatures on the order of microkelvins or less, have emerged as a versatile platform for studying a wide range of phenomena, including quantum gases, quantum information, and quantum many-body systems. One key aspect of ultracold atoms is their high degree of control over the initial state and evolution of the system, which allows for precise measurements and the realization of exotic states of matter. 

One technique that is commonly used to study the properties of ultracold atoms is time-of-flight expansion, in which the atoms are released from an optical trap and allowed to expand freely under the influence of gravity. During this expansion, the atoms acquire a momentum that is proportional to their initial kinetic energy, leading to a characteristic momentum distribution. However, the expansion is not entirely free, as the atoms are subject to various perturbations such as external fields and interactions with the environment. These perturbations can lead to deviations from the expected momentum distribution and can be used to manipulate the atomic state.

In this work, we show that matter-wave diffraction during the time-of-flight expansion of ultracold atoms can lead to symmetry-broken momentum distributions. Diffraction, which is the phenomenon of wavefronts bending around obstacles or through narrow openings, is a well-known effect in classical and quantum waves. However, the role of diffraction in the time-of-flight expansion of ultracold atoms has received relatively little attention. By controlling the initial state of the ultracold atoms and the expansion geometry, we are able to induce asymmetry in the momentum distribution, which would not be present in the absence of diffraction.","In summary, we have demonstrated that matter-wave diffraction during the time-of-flight expansion of ultracold atoms can lead to symmetry-broken momentum distributions. By controlling the initial state and expansion geometry, we are able to manipulate the momentum distribution in a way that would not be possible without diffraction. Our results provide a new method for manipulating the momentum distribution of ultracold atoms and could have applications in precision measurement and quantum simulations. Future work will focus on exploring the full range of possible momentum distributions and the conditions required for their realization."
"Shocked Molecular Hydrogen in the 3C 326 Radio Galaxy System","The 3C 326 radio galaxy is a powerful radio source located in the constellation Pisces. It is believed to be powered by a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. In this study, we used radio telescopes to detect the presence of shocked molecular hydrogen (H2) in the 3C 326 system. Our observations revealed the presence of H2 in the region surrounding the radio galaxy, indicating that the radio jets and outflows from the black hole are interacting with and heating the surrounding gas. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which radio galaxies release energy and contribute to the evolution of their host galaxies.","Radio galaxies are a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) that produce powerful radio emission due to the acceleration of particles in jets and outflows emanating from a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The 3C 326 radio galaxy is a well-studied example of this phenomenon, and previous observations have revealed the presence of a number of gaseous components in the system, including atomic hydrogen (H I), ionized hydrogen (H II), and molecular hydrogen (H2).

Molecular hydrogen is an important tracer of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy, and the presence of shocked H2 can provide valuable insights into the energy budget and dynamical processes at play in the system. In this study, we used radio telescopes to search for the presence of shocked H2 in the 3C 326 radio galaxy.","Our observations of the 3C 326 radio galaxy revealed the presence of shocked molecular hydrogen in the region surrounding the radio source. This suggests that the radio jets and outflows from the central black hole are interacting with and heating the surrounding gas, possibly through shock waves or other mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which radio galaxies release energy and contribute to the evolution of their host galaxies. Further studies of shocked H2 and other gaseous components in radio galaxies will be important for understanding the complex processes at play in these systems."
"Tidal deformability of boson stars and dark matter clumps","Boson stars and dark matter clumps are two hypothetical objects that have been proposed as potential candidates for dark matter. In this paper, we explore the tidal deformability of these objects, which is a measure of their response to external gravitational forces. We begin by reviewing the current state of knowledge on boson stars and dark matter clumps, including their physical properties and behavior. We then discuss the ways in which tidal deformability can be measured and calculated for these objects, and present some results from recent studies on the subject. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and outline some potential future directions for research in this area.","Dark matter is a mysterious substance that is thought to make up a significant fraction of the mass in the universe, yet its true nature remains unknown. Over the years, many different candidates have been proposed to explain this enigmatic substance, including boson stars and dark matter clumps.

Boson stars are composed of hypothetical particles known as bosons, which are characterized by their integer spin. They are believed to form through the gravitational collapse of bosons, and are thought to be extremely dense and compact objects. Dark matter clumps, on the other hand, are dense concentrations of dark matter that are thought to form through the gravitational collapse of normal matter. Both boson stars and dark matter clumps are thought to be important players in the evolution of galaxies and the structure of the universe.

One way to study these objects is to examine their response to external gravitational forces, which is known as tidal deformability. By measuring the tidal deformability of boson stars and dark matter clumps, we can gain insight into their physical properties and behavior.","In this paper, we have explored the tidal deformability of boson stars and dark matter clumps, two hypothetical candidates for dark matter. We have reviewed the current state of knowledge on these objects, including their physical properties and behavior, and discussed the ways in which tidal deformability can be measured and calculated for them.

In conclusion, the study of tidal deformability offers a promising avenue for furthering our understanding of these mysterious objects, and could potentially provide valuable insights into the nature of dark matter."
"Adversarial Images through Stega Glasses","Adversarial images are intentionally crafted to fool machine learning models into making incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to generating adversarial images using a novel device called "Stega Glasses." By overlaying a transparent layer of adversarial noise on top of a real image, Stega Glasses can fool image classification models into misinterpreting the content of the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique through a series of experiments and discuss its potential applications and limitations.","Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to compromise the security and reliability of these systems. Adversarial images, in particular, have been shown to be a powerful tool for fooling image classification models, leading to incorrect predictions with high confidence.

Traditionally, adversarial images have been generated using optimization algorithms that search for small perturbations to the pixel values of an input image that result in a desired misclassification. While effective, this approach has several limitations. First, the perturbations required to generate adversarial images can be visually noticeable to humans, making them easy to detect. Second, the optimization process can be time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge.

To address these limitations, we propose a new approach to generating adversarial images using a device called "Stega Glasses." Stega Glasses consist of a pair of eyeglasses equipped with a transparent layer that can be overlaid on top of a real image. By adding a small amount of adversarial noise to this layer, the content of the image can be altered in a way that is undetectable to the human eye but still able to fool image classification models.","In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to generating adversarial images using Stega Glasses. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in fooling image classification models and suggest that it has the potential to be a powerful tool for both researchers and attackers. However, the use of Stega Glasses also raises important questions about the security and reliability of machine learning systems in the presence of such adversarial attacks. Further research will be needed to fully understand the limitations and potential consequences of this approach."
"On the list decodability of Rank Metric codes","In this paper, we study the list decodability of rank metric codes. Rank metric codes are a class of error-correcting codes that operate on a matrix representation of the data, rather than on the traditional bit representation. The rank distance, which is the minimum number of rank-one matrices needed to express the difference between two codewords, is used as the metric for error correction. We present a method for constructing rank metric codes with good list decoding properties, and demonstrate the improved performance of these codes through simulation.","Error-correcting codes are a fundamental tool in communication systems, allowing for the reliable transmission of data over noisy channels. Traditional error-correcting codes, such as Hamming codes and Reed-Solomon codes, operate on a bit representation of the data. However, there has been growing interest in the use of rank metric codes, which operate on a matrix representation of the data.

One advantage of rank metric codes is their ability to correct errors that affect the structure of the data, rather than just individual bits. This makes them particularly well-suited for use in applications such as distributed storage systems, where data is stored across multiple nodes and errors may affect the relationships between the data stored on different nodes.

List decoding is a decoding technique that allows for the correction of a larger number of errors than traditional decoding methods, at the cost of increased complexity. In this paper, we focus on the list decodability of rank metric codes, i.e., the ability of a rank metric code to correct errors beyond the traditional decoding radius using list decoding.","In this paper, we have presented a method for constructing rank metric codes with good list decoding properties. Through simulation, we have demonstrated the improved performance of these codes compared to traditional rank metric codes. Our results suggest that rank metric codes with good list decoding properties may be a promising approach for reliable data transmission in applications where the structure of the data is important. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of these codes in practical settings."

It is used to study the fundamental properties of particles and the fundamental forces that govern them. One of the key processes studied at the LHC is diffractive bremsstrahlung, which occurs when a particle passes through a medium and loses energy due to the emission of bremsstrahlung radiation.
