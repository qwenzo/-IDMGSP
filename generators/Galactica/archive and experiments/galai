It is the second most common cancer in women in the USA, and the most common cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society, about 266,530 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in 2019, and about 42,090 will die of the disease [[START_REF] Cancer statistics, 2019, Siegel[END_REF]].\\n\\nBreast cancer can be classified into different types based on the histological features of the tumor cells. The histopathological features of the tumor cells include the size, shape, nucleus size, nucleus shape, nucleus membrane, and nucleolus [[START_REF] Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Analysis: A Review, Veta[END_REF]]. A pathologist examines the histopathological features of the tumor cells and reports the breast cancer type. Histopathological images of breast cancer are used to diagnose breast cancer. The classification of breast cancer using histopathological images is a challenging task because of the variation in the size and shape of the cells in the histopathological images of breast cancer.\\n\\nIn recent years, deep learning has been used in many applications, such as image classification, image segmentation, object detection, and image enhancement. Deep learning has outperformed the traditional machine learning methods for the classification of histopathological images of breast cancer [[START_REF] Deep Learning for Identifying Metastatic Breast Cancer, Wang[END_REF]]. Deep learning has also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods for the classification of other types of histopathological images, such as colon cancer [[START_REF] Deep learning based diagnosis of colon cancer, Alom[END_REF]], skin cancer [[START_REF] Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Diagnosis and Classification, Salam[END_REF]], and thyroid cancer [[START_REF] Thyroid Lesion Classification Using Deep Learning, Abi-Al-Haj[END_REF]].\\n\\nDeep learning has been used to classify breast cancer histopathological images into different classes. In [[START_REF] A deep learning approach for classifying breast cancer histology images using convolutional neural networks, Nayak[END_REF]], the authors used a deep learning model, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify the histopathological images of breast cancer. The proposed CNN model achieved 98.36% accuracy.

Lo\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\n# Background\\n\\n The use of machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of hospital readmission rates is increasingly popular. However, no study has compared the performance of different ML models for the prediction of 30-day all-cause readmission rates. \\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n The dataset used in this study was obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The prediction of 30-day all-cause readmission rates was conducted using the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models were compared. \\n\\n# Results\\n\\n The study included 139,785 patients. The GBDT model outperformed the RF and SVM models for the prediction of 30-day all-cause readmission rates (AUC: 0.825; accuracy: 0.806; sensitivity: 0.763; specificity: 0.821). The GBDT model also showed a better performance in terms of the calibration and discrimination of the predicted readmission rates. \\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\n The GBDT model outperformed the RF and SVM models for the prediction of 30-day all-cause readmission rates. The GBDT model could be an alternative to traditional ML models for the prediction of 30-day all-cause readmission rates.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nIn 2017, the annual economic burden of medical costs for the elderly population aged 65 years and older in Taiwan was estimated to be $402.3 billion [[START_REF] Annual economic burden of medical costs for the elderly population aged 65 years and older in Taiwan, 2017, Huang[END_REF]]. The National Health Insurance (NHI) program, which is compulsory for the entire population of Taiwan, is the main source of healthcare financing in Taiwan. The NHI program provides a comprehensive set of medical services for patients who can afford them, such as medical imaging, diagnostic tests, and treatment [[START_REF] The National Health Insurance Research Database: a review of scientific applications, Lin[END_REF]]. In addition, the NHI program provides a 2-year pre- and postdischarge follow-up program for all patients, which enables researchers to conduct large-scale cohort studies on healthcare utilization and outcomes.\\n\\nThe readmission rate is a commonly used measure of healthcare utilization and an important indicator of healthcare quality [[START_REF] Predicting Hospital Readmission Using a Hybrid Model of Logistic Regression and Random Forest, Park[END_REF], [START_REF] Predicting 30-Day Readmission Rates for Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review, DeGabriel[END_REF]]. The readmission rate is defined as the number of patients who have a rehospitalization within 30 days after discharge divided by the number of patients who have a discharge. The readmission rate is an important indicator of the quality of healthcare and is widely used to evaluate healthcare services [[START_REF] Predicting 30-Day Readmission Rates for Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review, DeGabriel[END_REF]]. A previous study reported that a higher readmission rate is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality [[START_REF] Association between 30-day readmission rate and patient mortality in the United States: a cross-sectional study, Wang[END_REF]]. In addition, a high readmission rate can be associated with a high cost and increased healthcare utilization [[START_REF] The association between the number of unplanned hospital readmissions and total health care expenditure in Taiwan, 2009–2013, Tsai[END_REF]]. Therefore, predicting the readmission rate is an important task for healthcare policy-makers.\\n\\nIn recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of readmission rates has increased. For example, ML models have been used to predict readmission rates for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [[START_REF] Machine Learning Models for Predicting Hospital Readmission for Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Zhang[END_REF]], heart failure [[START_REF] Predicting 30-Day Readmission Rates for Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review, DeGabriel[END_REF]], and myocardial infarction [[START_REF] Predicting Hospital Readmission Using a Hybrid Model of Logistic Regression and Random Forest, Park[END_REF]]'"]},"execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["model.generate(\"Title: The Best Deep Learning Model\", new_doc=True, top_p=0.7, max_length=1000)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":196},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9407,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668971009177,"user":{"displayName":"Mohamed Abdalla","userId":"12825786562748622169"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"dnGJPeD-a1FX","outputId":"4838ea7d-dc18-45e4-c325-5b944a514c83"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'Title\\n\\n The Best Deep Learning Model 2019 is a competition held by the IEEE Data Science Bowl.

To this end, we compare the performance of three state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems trained on English-German parallel corpora: phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT), neural machine translation (NMT), and sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation (seq2seq). We find that while all three systems perform well on a standard English-German translation task, they do not perform as well on the domain of legal texts. In particular, we find that NMT and seq2seq perform substantially worse than SMT on the domain of legal texts, and that this difference is not due to differences in translation quality or training data size. In contrast, we find that NMT and seq2seq perform better on non-legal texts, such as newspaper articles. We find that the difference in performance between NMT and seq2seq on legal texts is mainly due to differences in the way they model the domain of legal texts. In particular, we find that NMT is better at modelling word order and syntax than seq2seq.\\n\\n# 1 Introduction\\n\\nThe performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems has been steadily improving in recent years. In particular, neural machine translation (NMT) systems have shown a large increase in performance, with new state-of-the-art systems performing on par with phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF][START_REF] Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning, Gehring[END_REF][START_REF] Attention is All you Need, Vaswani[END_REF].\\n\\nNMT systems, in contrast to phrase-based SMT systems, are trained end-to-end, where the input is encoded into a sequence of vectors and the output is encoded into a sequence of vectors. The vectors are typically represented by word embeddings and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which allows the model to learn the composition of words in the input sentence. In this way, NMT systems can better model the dependencies between words in the input sentence than phrase-based SMT systems, and they can thus perform better on longer sentences [START_REF] Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Cho[END_REF][START_REF] Attention is All you Need, Vaswani[END_REF].\\n\\nThe recent advances in NMT have made it possible to build end-to-end NMT systems that can translate long sentences, as opposed to phrase-based SMT systems, which are limited to a maximum sentence length of 50-100 words [START_REF] On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder–Decoder Approaches, Cho[END_REF]. While this may be sufficient for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, it is not sufficient for tasks that require understanding of longer text, such as legal texts. The ability of NMT systems to understand longer text is essential for many NLP tasks, including information extraction, question answering, and semantic parsing. However, NMT systems have not been as successful in the domain of legal texts, where the language is not as complex as English. This is in contrast to the domain of machine translation, where NMT systems perform on par with SMT systems [START_REF] On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder–Decoder Approaches, Cho[END_REF].\\n\\nThis article investigates how well NMT systems perform on the domain of legal texts. We compare the performance of three state-of-the-art NMT systems: (1) a phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system, (2) a neural machine translation (NMT) system, and (3) a sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation (seq2seq) system. To this end, we train the NMT systems on English-German parallel corpora. We then evaluate the performance of the NMT systems on two datasets of legal texts. We find that the performance of the NMT systems on legal texts is significantly worse than the performance of the SMT systems on legal texts. In contrast, we find that the performance of the NMT systems on legal texts is similar to the performance of the SMT systems on non-legal texts. We also find that the performance of the NMT systems on legal texts is substantially worse than the performance of the seq2seq systems on legal texts. This difference is mainly due to differences in the way the NMT and seq2seq systems model the domain of legal texts. In particular, we find that the seq2seq systems perform better at modelling word order and syntax than the NMT systems.\\n\\nIn the next section, we describe the three NMT systems that we compare in this article.

We have many different regions that perform different functions. The human brain is not a single entity but rather a complex network of regions that interact with each other. We can understand how the brain works in the context of this network. It is important to understand the structure and function of the brain to understand the human mind.\\n\\n# 2.1\\n\\nWhy is the brain so complex?\\n\\nThe brain is composed of neurons. Each neuron is a tiny ball of protein that works as a tiny electrical conductor. Each neuron receives and processes information from the environment. The brain is a huge network of neurons. In the brain, each neuron interacts with other neurons. The connections between neurons are called synapses. There are many different types of synapses.\\n\\n# 2.2\\n\\nWhat are synapses?\\n\\nA synapse is a connection between neurons. It is the point where the neurons send and receive information. There are three types of synapses: chemical synapses, electrical synapses, and gap junctions.\\n\\n# 2.3\\n\\nWhat is chemical synapse?\\n\\nChemical synapses are made up of neurotransmitter molecules. The neurotransmitter molecules are released from the presynaptic neuron and diffuse through the synaptic cleft into the postsynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitter molecules bind to the receptors of the postsynaptic neuron. The receptors then change their state. When the receptor is in the activated state, the postsynaptic neuron is stimulated. When the receptor is in the inactive state, the postsynaptic neuron is not stimulated.\\n\\n# 2.4\\n\\nWhat is electrical synapse?\\n\\nAn electrical synapse is the connection between two neurons that uses an electrical signal. The electrical signal is transmitted through the electrical synapses. The electrical synapses are made up of gap junctions. The gap junctions are small pores between the neurons. When the gap junctions are opened, the voltage difference between the two neurons can be measured. When the voltage difference is high, the two neurons are stimulated.\\n\\n# 2.5\\n\\nWhat is gap junction?\\n\\nGap junctions are small pores between the cells. They allow small molecules to pass through.

Text Mining\\n\\nText mining is a subfield of information retrieval. The main purpose of text mining is to extract information from a text corpus. Text mining is widely used in different fields, such as social media analysis, document retrieval, and text summarization. Text mining is an important part of NLP. Text mining is also called as text mining.\\n\\n# 2.1. Basic Terms\\n\\nText mining is a process of extracting information from a text corpus. The information extracted from a text corpus can be categorized into three types:\\n1. Semantic information\\n2. Syntactic information\\n3. Lexical information\\n\\n# 2.2. Semantic Information\\n\\nSemantic information refers to the meaning of the text. It is the meaning of the text expressed by the words and phrases in the text. The meaning of the text is the result of the interaction between the words and phrases in the text. It is a very important part of text mining. The meaning of the text is expressed by the following two types of information:\\n1. Synonymy\\n2. Anonymity\\n\\n# 2.3. Syntactic Information\\n\\nSyntactic information refers to the syntax of the text. It is the syntax of the text expressed by the words and phrases in the text. Syntactic information is an important part of text mining. The syntax of the text is expressed by the following two types of information:\\n1. Word order\\n2. Lexical information\\n\\n# 2.4.

In this survey, we focus on a subset of these tasks namely (i) NLU, (ii) NLG, and (iii) NLU-NLG. As the number of available publicly available datasets for each of these tasks is increasing, researchers have proposed neural-based methods for natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG). Recent trends in NLP research have shown remarkable performance gain in different tasks in NLU, NLG, and NLU-NLG.\\n\\nOur goal in this survey is to discuss recent trends in NLP research (i) with respect to different tasks in NLU and NLG (e.g., semantic parsing, dialog systems, dialogue agent, etc.), (ii) with respect to data in NLU, NLG, and NLU-NLG (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization, etc.), and (iii) with respect to state-of-the-art performance in these tasks.\\n\\nThe survey is organized as follows. We start by introducing NLP tasks, available publicly available datasets, and models in Section 2. Next, we review state-of-the-art performance on different tasks in Section 3, followed by a detailed discussion of state-of-the-art on publicly available datasets for each task in Section 4. After this, we look at various trends in NLP research in Section 5. We discuss various challenges in future research directions in Section 6. The survey ends with conclusions in Section 7.\\n\\n# 2. The State of the Art in NLP\\n\\nOver the last two decades, NLP research has evolved into a highly active field of research, including the introduction of new tasks, new models for existing tasks, and datasets. We discuss the key points of interest for the reader.\\n\\n# 2.1. Tasks\\n\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) aims to understand and represent the meaning and content of natural languages. It is a challenging area of artificial intelligence due to its broad definition which encompasses many different areas of study and technologies including computer science, humanities and linguistics. There exist many tasks in NLP, which fall under various categories. For the purpose of this survey, we focus on three main categories, which have been very popular in the area of NLP tasks (Bansal\\net al., [START_REF] Speech and Language Processing, Jurafsky[END_REF]; Liu\\net al., [START_REF] A Survey on Natural Language Processing: Models, Applications and Methods, Liu[END_REF]).\\n\\n# 2.1.1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\\n\\nNatural language understanding aims to understand the intent of a user/speaker, the meaning of a sentence, as well as understanding its intention and the type of a task it is being used for. It also plays an important role in dialogue systems, conversational agents, chatbots, question answering systems and semantic parsing (Bansal\\net al., [START_REF] Speech and Language Processing, Jurafsky[END_REF]; Liu\\net al., [START_REF] A Survey on Natural Language Processing: Models, Applications and Methods, Liu[END_REF]). The task of NLU includes understanding the sentiment, emotion, subjectivity, intent, and opinion.\\n\\n# 2.1.2. Natural Language Generation (NLG)\\n\\nNatural language generation involves generating a natural language sentence based on some given conditions like domain, domain-specific knowledge (e.g., knowledge-based dialogue systems). As the ability to generate text is vital in many important applications (Kurihara et al., [START_REF] Data-to-text Generation with Content Selection and Planning, Kurihara[END_REF]; Zhang\\net al., [START_REF] Unsupervised Machine Translation Using Monolingual Corpora Only, Lample[END_REF]), various approaches have been proposed in this area to improve the quality of the generated text. Some examples of such tasks are machine translation (Niehues\\net al., [START_REF] A Comprehensive Survey on Machine Translation, Niehues[END_REF]), summarization (Xu\\net al., [START_REF] Exploring Neural Text Summarization for Abstractive Summary, Xu[END_REF]), dialog systems (Li et al., [START_REF] A Review of Dialogue Systems for Intelligent Tutoring Systems: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Perspectives, Li[END_REF]) and story generation (Fan\\net al., [START_REF] Story Ending Generation with Incremental Encoding and Commonsense Knowledge, Fan[END_REF]).\\n\\n# 2.1.3. Natural Language Understanding-Generation (NLU-NLG)\\n\\nNatural language understanding-generation aims to combine information from two different domains to generate a text based on the provided conditions. A large amount of research has been done in this area to perform both NLU as well as NLG tasks in the same system. This is also known as knowledge-enhanced generation (Yin\\net al., [START_REF] Knowledge Enhanced Dialog System, Yin[END_REF]).\\n\\n# 2.2. Datasets\\n\\nThe main motivation for collecting datasets for NLP tasks is to enable the development and evaluation of algorithms that allow the user to interact with their products, devices, applications and services in a natural manner (Bansal\\net al., [START_REF] Speech and Language Processing, Jurafsky[END_REF]). There are various datasets available for natural language understanding, natural language generation, and natural language understanding-generation tasks. In this section, we discuss key NLP tasks in detail and their available publicly available datasets for further reference.\\n\\n# 2.2.1. Natural Language Understanding Datasets\\n\\nThere are many datasets available for natural language understanding tasks. Below, we highlight the datasets for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, opinion mining, knowledge-base completion, semantic parsing, entity extraction, and question answering.\\n\\nSentiment Analysis (SA). SA refers to the analysis of texts to identify the sentiment expressed by the users towards a product or a service. The task is to extract the sentiment about the products, products & services, and to classify them into three broad categories: negative, neutral, and positive.\\n\\nSENTIWORDNET. The Sen-tiwordnet is a wordnet for evaluating sentiment analysis. It provides an evaluation metric named the wordNet-based Sentimental Analysis of Movies (WANSMO) to measure the degree of polarity in movies. The WANSMO score evaluates the polarity of a movie by using the words in the movie text. \\n\\nTREC06. The Task 1 dataset of TREC 2006 contains more than 100,000 reviews from Yelp. The task is to classify the reviews into positive, neutral, and negative.\\n\\nR-AIMED. This dataset contains 10,000 restaurant reviews.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.generate(\"Title: Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\n\", new_doc=True, top_p=0.7, max_length = 1000)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":125},"id":"kLwfG4O6Glhj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669217352409,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4526,"user":{"displayName":"Mohamed Abdalla","userId":"12825786562748622169"}},"outputId":"cc724450-86ed-4995-a0ef-d42294a7aeff"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Title: Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nAbstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on the extraction of meaning from natural language.

The growth in the number of papers and papers published in the area of NLP can be attributed to several factors. First, NLP is a broad and complex field that involves multiple fields of research such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the Natural Sciences. Second, the advances in deep learning (DL) technology have resulted in the development of complex systems that can solve many NLP tasks that were previously considered hard. Third, the availability of powerful computational resources has enabled the development of very large datasets.\\n\\nThe development of NLP systems has been dominated by the use of traditional machine learning (ML) techniques. ML is a broad field that encompasses various machine learning algorithms. The main difference between ML and DL is that ML is a general purpose learning paradigm that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, while DL is a specialized paradigm that can be used to solve specific problems. In other words, ML is a general purpose learning paradigm, while DL is a specialized paradigm that can be used to solve specific problems. The main difference between DL and traditional ML is that DL is a special form of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and traditional ML is a special case of ANNs. The main advantage of DL over traditional ML is that it is able to automatically learn the optimal parameters for a particular task, while traditional ML is dependent on handcrafted feature engineering.\\n\\nDeep learning (DL) is an area of ML that involves the development of deep learning architectures that can be used to solve a wide range of tasks. DL is a subfield of ML that involves the development of deep learning architectures that can be used to solve a wide range of tasks.

One of the most important aspect of Natural Language Processing is to find appropriate word embeddings, that is how to convert a natural language text to some high dimensional representation. Word2Vec is the most prominent technique in this field. The main idea behind word2vec is to embed each word \"v\" in the text \"x\", into a low dimensional representation called \"vector\". Then the cosine similarity of the two vectors are used to find the proximity of any pair of words in the text. The main advantages of word2vec is that it takes in consideration both the local (word-to-word) and the global (sentence-to-sentence) structure of the language.

The recent emergence of deep learning models has demonstrated improvements in many tasks, particularly NLP, in the area of natural language understanding. Several deep learning models use a recurrent neural network (RNN) like sequence-to-sequence (S2S) models [START_REF] Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks, Sutskever[END_REF] and attention [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF]). The ability of these models to capture longer and shorter context with the incorporation of memory and attention has proven to be very effective. The ability of the models to extract information from several contexts enables them to handle a wide range of NLP tasks. For example, S2S models have been used for sequence prediction, data augmentation, sequence labeling, and image captioning tasks.\\n\\nThe emergence of recurrent and convolutional neural networks in the last few years has opened the possibility of using them for various NLP tasks. In the following sections, we discuss these deep learning models.\\n\\n# 4.1 Recurrent Neural Networks\\n\\n# 4.1.1 Long Short Term Memory\\n\\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is a variant of RNN that was introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [START_REF] Long Short-Term Memory, Hochreiter[END_REF] for text classification and sequence generation tasks. It has a two-dimensional memory structure which is inspired by the human hippocampus that can maintain long-term memory. The input data is fed into a LSTM cell which keeps track of its state. When it is time to output the sequence, the output is calculated by using the current state and the previous state. Figure 2.1 shows an example of the LSTM model that was used to learn an embedding space of words. \\n\\n# 4.1.2 Gated Recurrent Units\\n\\nGated recurrent units (GRU) are a variant of RNNs that were introduced by Cho et al. [START_REF] Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Cho[END_REF]. Unlike LSTM cells, GRU cells do not have an internal state and their gates are responsible for keeping the information out of the cell and for controlling the flow of information. Both models are popular and can work equally well in NLP.\\n\\n# 4.2 Convolutional Neural Networks\\n\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were introduced by LeCun et al. [START_REF] Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition, LeCun[END_REF] for image processing. CNNs are one-dimensional convolutional operations. Unlike recurrent and convolutional neural networks, convolutional layers are the only non-linear layers. This means that they are capable of modeling complicated and nonlinear relationships. In addition, their computation time is small compared to RNNs and LSTMs. In the following sections, we discuss several popular models and their applications in NLP.\\n\\n# 4.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks for Sequence Prediction\\n\\nIn order to extract features from sequences, CNNs can be applied in both encoder and decoder layers. While the decoder layer takes the hidden states of the encoder layer as input and predicts the output sequence. A recurrent layer is added on top of the decoder layer for the case where an output sequence is not a one-hot encoding of a class. Similarly, an attention layer is added on top of the decoder layer for the case where an output sequence is not a weighted sum of encoder hidden states. The CNN-RNN model is shown in Figure 2.2.\\n\\nThe authors in [START_REF] Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Cho[END_REF] extended the concept of encoder-decoder structures for sequence-to-sequence problems to sequence to image problems. In this work, the encoder and decoder layers were designed for image generation and image recognition, respectively. Figure 2.3 shows an example of a CNN-RNN-Attention encoder-decoder model for sequence-to-image classification. The input is a sequence of images where each image is a gray-scale image of size 3 × 3 pixels. The model consists of three layers of convolution, a LSTM layer and an attention layer. The output of the convolution layers is a tensor of size c × 1 × n, where c is the number of channels, 1 is the time dimension, and n is the number of patches in the input sequence. The LSTM layer operates on the tensor \\n\\n× n 1 × n 2 × k 1 × k 2 × o 1 × o 2\\n, where k 1 and k 2 are the kernel sizes for the convolution layers, o 1 and o 2 are the output channels, and n 1 and n 2 are the output time steps.

This is partly due to the effectiveness of DL models in solving complex tasks using large corpora and large datasets. In general, NLP applications are considered challenging as these applications require the utilization of large amounts of data. Furthermore, since the training and inference of NLP models require the utilization of huge computational resources, a lot of efforts have been put into developing and evaluating novel methods that could effectively utilize these resources.\\n\\nTable 1: Comparison of language models performance on different classification tasks. The numbers reported in the table are average accuracy across multiple runs.\\n\\nOne such effort that received a lot of attention is the usage of pretrained language models (PLMs). These PLMs are originally trained on a large-scale unannotated corpus and are then fine-tuned on large corpora, with the goal of improving upon the performance of state-of-the-art models [[START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF], [START_REF] XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding, Yang[END_REF]]. To date, PLMs have been shown to perform well on several NLP tasks [[START_REF] Pretrained Transformers as Universal Language Models, Yang[END_REF]] such as question answering [[START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF], [START_REF] XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding, Yang[END_REF]] and textual entailment [[START_REF] XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding, Yang[END_REF]].\\n\\nIn this paper, we perform an extensive survey of the current literature in NLP. We focus on the most popular and popular PLMs and compare their performances on a set of popular NLP classification tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification and Natural Language Inference (NLI). We report the performance of various PLMs such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, ELECTRA, T5, XLNet-large and T5-small across different datasets. We also compare the results obtained using PLMs against several strong baselines such as Bi-LSTM-CRF [[START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF]], XLNet [[START_REF] XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding, Yang[END_REF]], BART [[START_REF] BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension, Lewis[END_REF]], DistilBERT [[START_REF] DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter, Sanh[END_REF]] and SpanBERT [[START_REF] SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting Spans, Joshi[END_REF]]. In addition, we perform an analysis of the behavior of the different architectures on different datasets in order to understand the advantages and disadvantages of these architectures. We also perform an analysis on the behavior of PLMs across multiple datasets by studying the importance of different words and sentences when making predictions. In particular, we study which words and sentences are important for different NLP tasks and determine whether they are more important to predicting certain classes or to predicting the rest of the classes.\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the PLMs we utilize in this work. In Section 3, we describe the corpora used in our experiments. The details about the experimental settings and the experimental results are described in Section 4. Section 5 describes the detailed analysis of results we performed and Section 6 concludes the paper.\\n\\n# 2 Pre-trained Language Models\\n\\nWe will describe the four major PLMs we use in this paper. We will discuss their architectures and their training and fine-tuning steps.\\n\\n# 2.1 BERT [[START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF]]\\n\\nBERT is an architecture designed for NLP that was introduced in 2019 [[START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF]]. It uses a deep Bidirectional Transformer architecture that aims at capturing the context around an arbitrary token when making the prediction. BERT can be considered a sequence to sequence model with a special end token, [CLS], which is used to classify the entire sequence. BERT can be used for many tasks including language understanding and generation. For language understanding BERT consists of two transformer encoders: one for the left and one for the right sequence of the tokens. For language generation BERT consists of a single transformer encoder with a special [SEP] token used to break the input sequence into two halves.\\n\\nBERT was trained in a'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc2\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["'Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nIn this paper, we present a survey of current methods for semantic parsing. We give an overview of existing approaches in terms of problem formulation, semantic representations used in the representations of input and output utterances and the methods used for training and evaluation of neural-network based parsers. Additionally, we discuss the recent trend of applying neural-network models to a wide range of semantic-parsing tasks such as question answering and semantic parsing of text. Finally, we list open challenges in the field.\\n\\n# 1 Introduction\\n\\nWe are living in an information age in which the amount of textual content generated by online users is increasing exponentially. As we become more information-rich and more involved, it is essential to be able to automatically extract, organize, and organize information and to answer questions about that information. Semantic parsing has emerged as a promising way of achieving this goal by providing computers with semantic representations of natural language utterances and by supporting reasoning, inference, and other reasoning tasks.\\n\\nIn recent years, the rise of deep learning has had a tremendous impact on the research of NLP [START_REF] Deep Learning, Goodfellow[END_REF]. This technology allows machines to learn representations of natural language that are suitable for use in a variety of natural language processing applications. Although not everyone agrees on what is a good representation of meaning (Cartwright, 2001), there are various approaches in the literature to this matter. One approach takes a word-based perspective in which the meanings of words are represented as vectors of real numbers. In other approaches, it is assumed that the meaning of a word is encoded in the meaning of its context [START_REF] A Structured Self-attentive Sentence Embedding, Lin[END_REF]. Furthermore, some research groups have studied the problem from a hierarchical point of view where words, syntactic trees or logical forms are used as components in a hierarchy [START_REF] Learning to Map Sentences to Logical Form: Structured Classification with Probabilistic Categorial Grammars, Zettlemoyer[END_REF][START_REF] Learning Dependency-based Compositional Semantics, Liang[END_REF].\\n\\nSemantic parsing plays an essential role in many applications of artificial intelligence (AI) that require structured representations of natural language. The problem of parsing consists of transforming natural language utterances into a structured form, in which the structure can correspond to the syntax or semantics of the input utterance. As an example, in semantic parsing, a natural language question \"What is the capital of the USA\" could be transformed into a logical form like \"Capital\" (1) ? (2)? (3)?,\\n\\nwhere the question\\'s answer is in (3), each token is in (1) and each span in (2). For more details, we refer to Section 2 of the paper.\\n\\nSemantic parsing has the potential to help in building artificial intelligence systems that are more intuitive for humans and are able to achieve more precise information extraction from unstructured textual data. Semantic parsers could also aid in machine learning and artificial intelligence research to investigate complex semantic dependencies between text and entities such as entities, relations, etc. [START_REF] Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs, Berant[END_REF], where the input could be text or an image and the output could be some structured output that can be used for, for example, question answering, machine translation, or information extraction.\\n\\nIn this paper, we discuss different semantic parsing approaches and give an overview of the current state of the art in NLP. We list problems in semantic parsing and discuss the problem formulations commonly used for different semantic parsing tasks. We also describe the semantic representations used in different approaches. We then discuss the learning of semantic parsers with deep neural networks. We briefly discuss semantic parsing of text. Finally, we present open challenges in the field.\\n\\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the main approaches used in semantic parsing of natural language utterances. Section 3 describes the challenges in semantic parsing and approaches used to address these challenges. Section 4 gives an overview of different methods used in learning semantic parsers with deep neural networks. Section 5 explains semantic parsing of text. Finally, we present open challenges in the area in Section 6 and conclude with our conclusions in Section 7.\\n\\n# 2 Approaches to Semantic Parsing\\n\\nSemantic parsing is the process of transforming a natural language utterance into a structured representation that can be interpreted using machine-learning techniques, logical or rule-based inference mechanisms, and natural-language processing techniques. For instance, semantic parsers can be used to convert natural language question answering (QA) or information extraction (IE) tasks (Table 1) to semantic parsing problems [START_REF] Information Extraction over Structured Data: Question Answering with Freebase, Yao[END_REF][START_REF] Semantic Parsing on Freebase from Question-Answer Pairs, Berant'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc3\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["'Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nDeep learning has become a key paradigm in modern artificial intelligence and machine learning. It has achieved significant success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language understanding, machine translation, and speech recognition, among other applications. However, despite these successes, there still exist several limitations of deep learning. We argue that these shortcomings are mainly rooted in the complexity of natural language processing and the non-differentiability of deep neural networks (DNNs). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that combines neural networks with modern optimization tools from the field of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our method exploits the expressiveness of neural networks to build a smooth function in the parameters of a deep neural network. Based on this function we are able to perform gradient descent in the parameter space of a deep neural network and to learn effective models for language processing. In this paper we provide an overview of our work, demonstrate its benefits, and describe the key ideas of our approach.\\n\\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\\n\\n* We provide an overview of the state of the art in NLP, which is based on neural networks. We classify the methods into two categories: those based on neural networks for supervised learning and those based on neural networks for unsupervised learning. In each case, we review the most widely used deep learning approaches that are based on (1) word embeddings and (2) self-attention, and explain their advantages and disadvantages.\\n* We propose a novel method to train models in the parameter space of a deep neural network. Our method is capable of learning more general and robust models for language processing than existing neural models. We show that, on some benchmarks, we are even able to outperform existing neural models.\\n* We provide an in-depth analysis of the training of deep neural networks in the parameter space. We show that the choice of a suitable gradient descent algorithm can lead to a significant improvement in the performance of neural models for text classification and language modeling, as we will demonstrate in the experimental section.\\n\\nOur work demonstrates that it is possible to build better language models with deep neural networks by exploiting modern optimization techniques.\\n\\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we review related work from both the field of language processing and NLP based on deep neural networks. Section 3 reviews the state of the art in NLP based on word embeddings. In Section 4 we give a detailed overview of the optimization algorithm and the architecture of the neural model. In Section 5 we explain how to efficiently use a differentiable model in the parameter space of a DNN to perform SGD in parameter space. In Section 6 we present the experimental results showing the benefits of our approach. We conclude our work in Section 7 and discuss further work directions in Section 8.\\n\\n# 2 Related Work\\n\\nIn the following subsections we review the most well-known approaches for NLP based on neural networks.\\n\\n# 2.1 Word Embeddings\\n\\nWord embedding approaches (Mikolov et al., [START_REF] Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality, Mikolov[END_REF]; Arora et al., [START_REF] A unified architecture for natural language processing: deep neural networks with multitask learning, Collobert[END_REF]; Mikolov et al., [START_REF] Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations, Mikolov[END_REF]; Devlin et al., [START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF]), such as GloVe (Pennington et al., [START_REF] GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation, Pennington[END_REF]), FastText (Joulin et al., [START_REF] Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification, Joulin[END_REF]), and BERT (Devlin et al., [START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF]), are mainly based on the idea that similar words in a natural language have similar representations in a high-dimensional vector space.

It is a relatively broad research area that focuses on the development of tools and algorithms for natural language understanding, information extraction and language generation. Many natural language processing applications, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, machine translation, question generation and summarization, require complex NLP algorithms and knowledge. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art NLP research in terms of architectures, models, algorithms, and tools. We hope to provide an overview of the development of NLP and to help the community focus on the key areas and challenges in this area.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) has been a long term research area. It started when linguists observed and developed mathematical models for human language such as the famous Word-Word Grammar in 1950s. [START_REF] The Grammar of Human Speech, Sapir[END_REF] In that era, the core of NLP was linguistic theory and linguistics methods. During the 1970s and 1980s, researchers explored the relationships between linguistics and computer technology, and the emergence of computational linguistic techniques. [START_REF] Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Haberman[END_REF] There were still some limitations for these techniques such as their computational complexity, computational efficiency, and accuracy. With the emergence of the field of NLP in the early 2000s, many new NLP models and algorithms have been proposed and evaluated in the field of computer science.\\n\\nNLP has received significant attention from researchers, practitioners and scientists for the past decade, because this technology has become a key component for many industrial applications. NLP applications cover a wide range of areas such as information extraction, machine translation, question answering and sentiment analysis. [START_REF] Learning from Natural Language Text for Natural Language Processing, Socher[END_REF] NLP technologies can be classified into two categories based on how they operate: sequence-based models and tree-based models. Sequence-based models take a sequence of words from the input as input, where each word is represented by its one-hot representation. They usually model one aspect of the text, for example, semantic information, syntactic information, or the relationship between words. Tree-based models typically model the syntax of a sentence, and assign a label or word vector for each node in the tree. Tree-based models are used for modeling the sentence structure and for word and sentence classification, and they require less computation time than sequence-based models. For instance, Tree-LSTMs, Tree-RNNs and Tree-Transformers have been proposed to overcome the limitations of the previously mentioned models. [START_REF] Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks, Tai[END_REF][START_REF] Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks, Tai[END_REF][START_REF] Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification, Kim[END_REF][START_REF] Tree-to-Sequence Attentional Neural Machine Translation, Eriguchi[END_REF] In this article, we present a comprehensive review of current NLP research in the field of natural language understanding, information extraction, sentiment analysis, machine translation, question answering, question generation and summarization, and we discuss the current state-of-the-art of this area in terms of model architectures, models, algorithms, tools and applications. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the development of NLP and to help the community focus on the key areas and challenges in this area.\\n\\n# Model Architectures\\n\\nNLP models can be divided into two categories based on the models architecture: deep learning models and pre-trained language models. Deep learning models represent each word of the sentence as a vector of fixed length, such as one-hot vectors. Deep learning models were originally designed to solve regression and classification problems. Nowadays, these models are also used as the basis for more complex NLP applications. The most popular deep learning models are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). [START_REF] Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch, Collobert[END_REF] Pre-trained language models use large pre-trained language models for NLP applications. These language models are trained on big corpora and then fine-tuned on their specific task using a few hundred examples. [START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF][START_REF] Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks, Reimers[END_REF] \\n\\n# Deep Learning Models\\n\\nCNN and LSTM networks (Fig. 1) are widely used for text classification. [START_REF] Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch, Collobert[END_REF][START_REF] Effective Use of Word Order for Text Categorization with Convolutional Neural Networks, Johnson[END_REF][START_REF] Text Categorization with Recurring Multi-Order Convolutional Neural Networks'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc5\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["'Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nContextualized word representations are one of the crucial components of recent state-of-the-art natural language understanding models. These representations have been shown to enable state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks such as language and language-agnostic natural language inference [START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF][START_REF] XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding, Yang[END_REF], lexical and semantic similarity , question answering [START_REF] Question Answering with Subgraph Embeddings, Bordes[END_REF][START_REF] Natural Language Question Answering Using Machine Reading Comprehension, Cui[END_REF][START_REF] Learning General Purpose Distributed Sentence Representations via Large Scale Multi-task Learning, Subramanian[END_REF], language modeling [START_REF] Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners, Radford[END_REF] and so on. For example, BERT, the state-of-the-art model for language modeling [START_REF] Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners, Radford[END_REF], is an Transformer-based encoder-decoder pre-trained on a masked language model and next sentence prediction objective. GPT-3, the state-of-the-art language-modeling model, is a large-scale, multi-task language model which is trained on a massive amount of unlabeled text and performs at 3.16% accuracy on the GLUE benchmark [START_REF] A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference, Williams[END_REF], the leaderboard for evaluating various models of natural language understanding. While contextualized word representations have been shown to be effective for a number of NLP tasks, they are not a panacea. For example, they have been shown to be less effective in semantic tasks such as textual entailment [START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF].\\n\\nIn this work, we conduct a thorough investigation of word representations in the context of the recently introduced XNLI dataset [START_REF] XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations, Conneau[END_REF]. First, we show that the standard word embedding approaches used for representing words such as GloVe [START_REF] GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation, Pennington[END_REF] and Word2Vec [START_REF] Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality, Mikolov[END_REF] are suboptimal in the context of XNLI. Next, we investigate the effect of replacing contextualized representations with \"traditional\" word representations on the ability of XNLI to capture cross-lingual representations. Then we show that the word embeddings derived from pre-trained Transformer-based language models are superior to \"traditional\" word representations in the context of XNLI, but we find that the former require a non-trivial amount of data for fine-tuning. Finally, we propose a set of architectural changes and training strategies that have enabled our state-of-the-art results and also show that fine-tuning the model on an additional, unlabeled dataset (300MB) improves the performance of BERT substantially and significantly reduces the data requirement. Our code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/XNLI.\\n\\n2 Background\\n\\n# 2.1 Word Embeddings\\n\\nOne of the most frequently used methods of representing words is the bag-of-words approach [START_REF] An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Dixon[END_REF][START_REF] A Comprehensive Survey on Word Embeddings: Methods, Applications, and Evaluation, Durrani[END_REF]. In this approach, words are represented as one-hot vectors where each element is a value equal to 1 if the corresponding word exists in a dictionary. Bag-of-words representations of words have shown to be useful for many NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation [START_REF] Word sense disambiguation: A survey, Navigli[END_REF].\\n\\nOne of the most frequently used methods of representing words is the use of word vectors that learn a word-word similarity. Word vectors provide a high-dimensional embedding of words that is typically high-dimensional, and are learned from data such as textual corpora. Various popular word embeddings include Skip-gram [START_REF] Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality, Mikolov[END_REF], GloVe [START_REF] GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation, Pennington[END_REF] and Word2Vec [START_REF] Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality, Mikolov[END_REF].\\n\\nWord embeddings have been shown to be useful in many NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, machine translation, text summarization and question answering. A recent survey [START_REF] A Comprehensive Survey on Word Embeddings: Methods, Applications, and Evaluation, Durrani[END_REF] summarizes most of the work conducted on word embedding to date and discusses its applications in the context of different NLP tasks. A comparison of word embeddings including GloVe and Word2Vec can be found in [START_REF] Word Embeddings: A Survey, Maas'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc6\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["'Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nIn this paper we present a literature survey on the application of machine learning approaches to natural language processing. In our survey we focus on deep learning approaches. We first outline some of the basic architectures commonly used in neural language models in section 2. We then outline recent research on deep neural models.\\n\\n# 1 Introduction\\n\\nIn recent years, significant advances in deep learning, in particular in neural networks, have helped greatly in advancing the state of the art in different fields of research. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a special type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is built upon simple components called neurons. The neurons connect together to perform some task through a very powerful computational model inspired by the structure and workings of neurons in the human brain [START_REF] The perceptron: a probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain., ROSENBLATT[END_REF].\\n\\nNeural networks have been used in many different applications, and particularly for NLP. The use of neural networks for NLP has recently gained significant attention as deep learning models have been shown to achieve high performance, sometimes even surpassing humans [START_REF] Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing with Neural Networks, Pereira[END_REF].\\n\\nThe main objective of this paper is to highlight the recent advances in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications. We highlight and discuss the different aspects of NLP in relation to deep learning techniques. As we will discuss below, many of the aspects of NLP rely upon machine learning techniques, and this has been a significant driving force for deep learning applications in NLP.\\n\\nThe research areas and applications related to deep learning for NLP have recently gained much popularity. We will briefly discuss the main research areas in relation to deep learning in this paper. In section 4 we will briefly discuss the applications of deep learning in NLP.\\n\\n# 2 Deep neural language models\\n\\nNeural language models have been used to learn to process natural language to achieve a good performance in many tasks and applications. In this section we will discuss the most popular neural language models.\\n\\n# 2.1 Sequence-to-sequence models\\n\\nThe classical approach in NLP for word-level classification tasks is to build an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) [START_REF] Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition, LeCun[END_REF] using the sequence of words as input and classifying the words into classes. In this approach the words are represented as a sequence of words (often as sub-word sequences, which will be discussed shortly) and the input is a sequence of words, i.e. each word is a token in the sequence. The MLP then transforms the sequence of words into a sequence of classes using a series of transformations.\\n\\nMore recently, research has gone into learning from sentence-level data, instead of looking at the words in isolation. In this approach, a fixed-length sequence of words is usually processed in parallel, using multiple LSTM networks, to learn a sentence representation. A sequence-to-sequence architecture, such as this, was originally proposed by [START_REF] Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Cho[END_REF][START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF][START_REF] A Neural Conversational Model, Vinyals[END_REF] as a solution for Machine Translation.\\n\\nThe architecture of such a sequence-to-sequence model is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nThe sequence-to-sequence models usually consist of an encoder, followed by a decoder. The encoder encodes the input sequence to a latent vector. The decoder then transforms the latent vector from the encoder into a sequence of words. This approach has since been used for many NLP tasks, including classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis [START_REF] Learning Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding for Twitter Sentiment Classification, Tang[END_REF].\\n\\nAnother approach to using sequence-to-sequence models is to use recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the sequential patterns in the input sequence [START_REF] Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks, Graves[END_REF][START_REF] A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data, Chung[END_REF][START_REF] Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Cho[END_REF]. Recurrent networks are special type of neural networks that can retain the information from previous values. They are useful in problems where the length of the input sequence is not fixed, such as sentence completion.\\n\\n# 2.2 Long Short-Term Memory models\\n\\nLSTMs have been successfully used for sequence-to-sequence models [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF][START_REF] A Neural Conversational Model, Vinyals[END_REF][START_REF] Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Cho[END_REF][START_REF] On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder–Decoder Approaches, Cho[END_REF][START_REF] Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc7\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["\"Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nIn this paper, we survey various types of NLP methods that focus on classification of textual and multimedia data. NLP is an increasingly popular field of research and one that has gained significant popularity and excitement over the last decade. However, due to the vast amount of textual and multimedia data, it is difficult for even skilled NLP specialists to process these data, especially because these data are large. As such, NLP methods are being used to assist other ML methods -a trend known as Mixed-Initiative Learning (MIL). The goal of MIL is to improve the performance of other ML tasks by providing additional NLP information. We survey NLP methods that have been used in this context, and discuss how NLP methods can improve the performance of other tasks and ML problems.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nThe last decade has seen the rapid growth of textual and multimedia data. While the growth of textual and multimedia data is very significant, the task of using NLP to process and understand these data still remains challenging, especially for humans, as the amount of textual and multimedia data to process continues to grow. NLP has many applications, which include information retrieval [START_REF] Information retrieval. A short course, Dumais[END_REF][START_REF] Machine learning in automated text categorization, Sebastiani[END_REF][START_REF] Introduction to information retrieval, Manning[END_REF], question answering [START_REF] The Goldilocks Principle: Reading Children's Books with Explicit Memory Representations, Hill[END_REF], information extraction [START_REF] Overview of Text Summarization, Goldstein-Stewart[END_REF], summarization [START_REF] Automatically Constructing a Corpus of Sentential Paraphrases, Dolan[END_REF][START_REF] Summarizing Source Code using a Neural Attention Model, Iyer[END_REF], translation [START_REF] The Mathematics of Statistical Machine Translation: Parameter Estimation, Brown[END_REF][START_REF] A Statistical Approach to Machine Translation, Brown[END_REF], and many more. In addition, NLP is also a field of study for itself. While it was once considered a sub-discipline of the Computer Science or Natural Sciences, it has now grown into a multi-disciplinary area that combines linguistics and ML [START_REF] Natural language processing: a survey, Bhattacharya[END_REF][START_REF] Natural language processing: a survey, Bhattacharya[END_REF]. Therefore, it is important to investigate NLP methods that have been developed and used for different kinds of data, including textual and multimedia data.\\n\\nOne of the main fields of NLP is information extraction (IE), the process of understanding and extracting meaningful information from unstructured data, such as documents, texts, and images [START_REF] Foundations of statistical natural language processing, Manning[END_REF][START_REF] A survey of information extraction techniques using natural language, Wong[END_REF][START_REF] Introduction to information extraction, Liu[END_REF][START_REF] Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, AgrawalRakesh[END_REF]. IE methods can be used for different tasks, such as entity extraction and relation extraction (Saeki and Nakashole, 2011), text classification [START_REF] Text categorization, Sebastiani[END_REF], and document summarization [START_REF] Automatic Text Summarization, Sridhar[END_REF][START_REF] An Unsupervised Multidocument Summarization Technique, Hovy[END_REF]. In addition, IE methods have been used in conjunction with other ML techniques to obtain results that are better or more efficient [START_REF] Machine learning applications in automated text categorization, Zou[END_REF]. As such, the applications of IE have grown to include text summarization [START_REF] Automatic Text Summarization, Sridhar[END_REF][START_REF] Automatic summarization of Web documents, Cachola[END_REF] and machine translation [START_REF] Machine translation in computer-aided translation, Kress-Gazit[END_REF].\\n\\nAs textual and multimedia data continue to grow, so does the need to apply NLP methods to help extract information. However, it is still challenging to understand text-based and multimedia data for a human. This is especially true for multimedia data. Multimedia data are often organized into sets of images and videos with specific descriptions and tags. As a result, NLP methods are needed to help humans understand the meaning of these data.\\n\\nAnother area that has seen increased research and popularity is the use of NLP methods for supporting ML tasks (see (Fan and [START_REF] Learning with Mixed-Initiative in the Large, Fan[END_REF][START_REF] Mixed-Initiative Learning in Machine Learning, Yang[END_REF] and references therein)). This has been referred to as Mixed-Initiative Learning (MIL) [START_REF] The Art of Mixed-Initiative Learning, Kolodner[END_REF][START_REF] Mixed-Initiative Learning in Machine Learning, Yang[END_REF]. MIL focuses on how to aid other ML algorithms by providing some NLP information [START_REF] The Art of Mixed-Initiative Learning, Kolodner[END_REF][START_REF] Mixed-Initiative Learning in Machine Learning, Yang[END_REF]. As the amount of textual and multimedia data continues to grow, more and more NLP methods are being applied. The goal of MIL is to make the learning process more efficient, accurate, and efficient, by augmenting other ML methods with\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc8\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["'Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nAs the language has become the main form of data for most of today\\'s businesses and information systems, there has been a significant interest in using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to deal with tasks in business and information systems. The main objective of NLP is to make the process of acquiring, analysis, interpreting, summarizing and creating information of human languages more natural and understandable. Nowadays, these techniques have proven to be effective and have a high accuracy in many tasks such as translation, question answering, information extraction, sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Thus, NLP is becoming a popular research area that has gained attention among the research community.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we overview the current state of the art of different NLP applications in business and information systems. Firstly, we review different NLP approaches such as Natural Language Generation, Classification, Clustering, Topic Detection, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Disambiguation and Open-Domain Question Answering. Secondly, we describe different NLP challenges and their corresponding datasets in the field of business and information systems. Then, we compare the approaches in each task and present their main advantages and limitations. Finally, we briefly summarize these approaches and discuss future directions.\\n\\n# 2.1.1 Natural Language Generation\\n\\nNatural Language Generation (NLG) refers to generating texts from some high-level domain-specific representations. This technique allows users to interact with systems in a more natural way (i.e., without having to write human-like sentences). The aim of NLG is to allow the user to interact with the system in a more natural way (i.e., without having to write human-like sentences), but without having to know any linguistic knowledge beforehand [START_REF] Introduction to NLP in the Context of Business Intelligence & Data Science: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Dinkova[END_REF].\\n\\nFigure 2.1: A general framework for applying NLP in Business and Information Systems.\\n\\nFigure 2.1 shows the overall framework of applying NLP in business and information systems. The system consists of three main modules: natural language understanding, natural language processing and generation. The first module is called natural language understanding and is responsible for analysing the user\\'s input and producing the corresponding natural language representation of the input. For example, the user\\'s input is the text \"I\\'m a sales and marketing specialist, I specialise in shopping and finance, but I also do sales.\"; the first step in this analysis is to identify the words which relate to \"shopping\" and \"finance\". In other words, the system has to recognise the set of words representing the meaning of the sentence (i.e., which entities are being referred by the sentence). Then, the second module applies the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform the required processing. For example, the first step in this processing is to extract entities and relations from the input sentence. Finally, the last module is the Natural Language Generation (NLG), which is responsible for generating the corresponding natural language output. For example, the output could be: \"A sales and marketing specialist specialises in shopping and finance, but I also do sales. I have several clients.\".\\n\\n# 2.1.2 Classification\\n\\nClassification is the technique of assigning one of a given set of predefined classes to an instance. In many applications, such as classification of documents, users can specify the classes they are interested in. The goal is to find a model for a set of instances to be classified [START_REF] An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Clark[END_REF]. The most commonly used approaches in NLP are the Probabilistic methods and the Machine Learning (ML) techniques. For example, the Probabilistic methods, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [START_REF] Machine Learning - An Algorithmic Perspective, Marsland[END_REF] and the Machine Learning techniques, such as Naive Bayes [START_REF] Machine Learning - An Algorithmic Perspective, Marsland[END_REF] and support vector machine (SVM) [START_REF] Machine Learning - An Algorithmic Perspective, Marsland[END_REF].\\n\\nThe main advantage of probabilistic methods is that they are easy to implement and use in a variety of applications, while the main disadvantage is that they require the knowledge of the model parameters [START_REF] Machine Learning - An Algorithmic Perspective, Marsland[END_REF]. On the other hand, ML techniques are not very complicated to implement (because they require fewer assumptions about the data) and they can be used to fit any problem.\\n\\nHowever, ML techniques require more knowledge about the problem and the underlying assumption to classify the instances. Moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of ML techniques also depend on the dataset (i.e., the type of data, its size'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["doc9\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["\"Current state of the art in NLP, A Survey\\n\\nText-to-text Neural Networks (T2TNs) aim at mapping unstructured text to structured natural language for downstream tasks such as machine translation, summarization, natural language generation, and retrieval [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF][START_REF] Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation, Wu[END_REF][START_REF] A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization, Rush[END_REF][START_REF] Generating Wikipedia by Summarizing Long Sequences, Liu[END_REF][START_REF] A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization, Rush[END_REF][START_REF] A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization, Rush[END_REF][START_REF] Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks, See[END_REF][START_REF] Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders, Liu[END_REF]. Despite the promising results of T2TNs, these models still exhibit several limitations. First, T2TNs have difficulty generalizing from relatively small datasets to much larger ones [START_REF] Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners, Radford[END_REF]. Second, training T2TNs is computationally intensive, and consequently, these models require long training times.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a new T2TN called BERT++, which builds upon BERT [START_REF] BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Devlin[END_REF] to enhance its ability to generalize to much larger datasets. The key idea of our proposed method is to add an auxiliary task to BERT, which is related to the text summarization problem, so that the trained model is able to automatically generate the appropriate number of sentences based on the input text. Then, to train the auxiliary task objective with the training objective of BERT, we introduce a joint objective of the tasks that are used in training. Unlike [START_REF] Cross-Lingual Language Model Pretraining, Lample[END_REF] that uses two different tasks for training in order to prevent the loss of important semantic features, we propose to use the same objective function to train both tasks. BERT++ is trained to perform sentence summarization using an auxiliary task and to be used as a T2TN. Our experimental results on multiple datasets (e.g., summarization, machine translation, and paraphrase detection) demonstrate that our proposed method can produce very similar or even better results than the state of the art.\\n\\n# Related Work\\n\\nT2TNs are trained to translate raw text to natural language by jointly modeling two tasks, i.e., generating the appropriate number of sentences and predicting the next word in each sentence. Neural machine translation [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF] and neural summarization [START_REF] A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization, Rush[END_REF] are the most prominent models of this type.\\n\\n# Neural Machine Translation\\n\\nThe encoder-decoder architecture was first proposed for neural machine translation (NMT) [START_REF] Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks, Sutskever[END_REF]. The encoder first maps the input sequence to a fixed length vector representation and then the decoder produces the corresponding target sequence. These model parameters are then learned using gradient backpropagation. However, the encoder-decoder architecture was later proposed for language modeling using the attention mechanism [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF].\\n\\n# Neural Summarization\\n\\nThe attention mechanism [START_REF] Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, Bahdanau[END_REF] is used to extract relevant tokens and generate an abstractive summary from long input sentences.

This work discusses a simple configuration for generating three photon nonclassical states and their subsequent measurement of their polarization. The basic setup relies on the combination of polarization-sensitive and polarization-preserving photodetectors. The OPDC scheme is first discussed both theoretically and experimentally for a realistic configuration in terms of the down conversion process and the properties of the photodetectors.

As the foundations of quantum mechanics were laid, the study of entanglement has developed into a distinct field of research . Entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and is defined mathematically as non-separability.\\nIn quantum optics, entangled photon pairs can be generated by nonclassical light sources such as parametric down conversion (PDC) , optical parametric amplification , degenerate four wave mixing , or spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) . A PDC process can be described as the spontaneous generation of two entangled photons when two pump photons, interacting with a nonlinear crystal, are coherently pumped in opposite directions, producing a state with a well defined joint polarization and a definite spatial correlation [START_REF] New high-intensity source of polarization-entangled photon pairs., Kwiat[END_REF]. The spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of the two photons can be entangled in many ways, providing new ways to describe and manipulate the quantum properties of the fields. In general, entangled particles are difficult to detect, and they provide the main advantage of allowing one to perform information processing that was previously unimaginable .\\n\\nThe first demonstration of entanglement between the spatial and polarization of a single photon in a nonlinear crystal was reported by Grangier et al. [START_REF] Observation of Quantum Entanglement of Photons Over More than 10 km, Pan[END_REF].

In the EPR experiment, two entangled\\nparticles are prepared in the same state, but one of them is\\nmeasured and the result is used to predict the result of the\\nmeasurement on the other particle.\\n\\nRecently, the EPR correlations of vector bosons have been\\ndiscussed in the framework of the standard model of electroweak\\ninteractions [, ]. The vector bosons are\\npredicted to exist and to be discovered at the CERN Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). The vector bosons are predicted to have a large\\ncoupling constant to the fermions and a small coupling constant to\\nthe vector bosons themselves. The small coupling constant\\nbetween the vector bosons and themselves is one of the main\\nfeatures of the standard model of electroweak interactions.\\n\\nThe aim of this paper is to study the EPR correlations of\\nvector bosons. In the standard model of electroweak interactions,\\nthe EPR correlations are generated by the exchange of vector\\nbosons between the particles in the initial and final states. We\\nshow that the correlation is proportional to the electromagnetic\\ncoupling constant and the vector boson mass.\\n\\n# The EPR correlations of vector bosons\\n\\nThe vector bosons are predicted to exist and to be discovered at\\nthe CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

A local observer in region \\(A\\) can measure the spin of the particle in this region and obtains the value \\(\\pm 1\\) with equal probability. A local observer in region \\(B\\) can measure the spin of the particle and obtain the value \\(\\pm 1/2\\) with equal probability. The value of the spin of the particle is correlated with the value of the spin of the particle measured by the local observer in region \\(B\\!\\).\n","\n","Now, we consider the EPR correlations of vector bosons.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that there are around 300 million people suffering from mental illness [3]. Mental illnesses affect people of all ages and genders. It is estimated that one in every five adult will suffer from a mental illness. The most common mental illnesses are depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Other mental illnesses include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism.\n","Social media is a major source of information for people with mental illness. It is estimated that 150 million people in the world use social media, which is about 18% of the global population [4].

The cross sections for the production of vector bosons with a charm quark in association with a heavy antiquark are computed at next-to-leading order in QCD, including the top-quark mass and the heavy-quark spin effects.

The existence of a second, massless SU(2) gauge boson, called the “Higgs boson”, is a prediction of the SM. The Higgs boson was discovered at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [START_REF] Observation of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, Collaboration[END_REF]; [START_REF] Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC, Collaboration[END_REF] in 2012. The LHC experiments have also observed the existence of a heavy quark with a mass of 125 GeV, which is consistent with the mass of the Higgs boson [START_REF] Observation of a new boson with mass near 125 GeV in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, Collaboration[END_REF]; [START_REF] Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at s=7$$ \\sqrt{s}=7 $$ and 8 TeV, Aad[END_REF]. However, the existence of the Higgs boson is not the only new feature of the SM. The SM also predicts the existence of the electroweak interaction between the two gauge bosons. The electroweak interaction of the SM is mediated by the exchange of the W and Z bosons. The existence of the two gauge bosons can be confirmed by studying the production and decay of the W and Z bosons. The electroweak interaction of the SM can be probed by measuring the spin correlation between the W and Z bosons.\n","\n","In the SM, the W and Z bosons are bosons of spin one. The W boson is produced in association with a single quark (\\(q\\)) or a pair of quarks (\\(q\\bar{q}\\)) in \\(pp\\) collisions at the LHC. The Z boson is produced in association with a single quark (\\(q\\)) or a pair of quarks (\\(q\\bar{q}\\)) in \\(pp\\) collisions at the LHC.
