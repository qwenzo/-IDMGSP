The polarizability of the noble gases is determined to a large extent by the polarizability of the noble gas atoms. The polarizability of the noble gas atoms is determined by the polarizability of the noble gas atoms and by the polarizability of the electron. The polarizability of the noble gas atoms is mainly determined by the polarizability of the noble gas atoms.\n","\n","Conclusion:\n","\"\"\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=512,\n","                         do_sample=True,\n","                         temperature=0.7,\n","                         top_k=25,\n","                         top_p=0.9,\n","                         no_repeat_ngram_size=10,\n","                         early_stopping=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sYqcEKwdgaF1"},"source":["## paper 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Xu5kJafkgRvZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 64\n","input_text = \"Title: Extensible Data Skipping\\n\\n\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=512,\n","                         do_sample=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"xh-eX767gm3-"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 64 + 512\n","input_text = \"\"\"\n","Title: Extensible Data Skipping\n","\n","Abstract: This paper proposes the extendible data skipping model (EDS) for large data collections.

The data skipping technique is used to process the data items which can be skipped in the processing pipeline. The data skipping technique has a good performance for processing streaming data. The data skipping technique has been used for various data processing applications such as the data mining and data warehousing. However, the data skipping technique has a limitation that it can not skip the data items which are out of the processing pipeline. For example, consider a data processing pipeline shown in Figure 1. The data processing pipeline consists of two processing methods which are a data mining method and a data cleaning method. The data mining method processes the data items in the order of data item 1, data item 2,..., and data item n. The data cleaning method processes the data items in the reverse order of data item 1, data item n, data item n-1,..., and data item 2. The data skipping technique can skip the data item 2 and 3 because the data item 2 is in the processing pipeline and the data item 3 is out of the processing pipeline. However, the data skipping technique cannot skip the data item 4 because the data item 4 is out of the processing pipeline. In addition, the data skipping technique cannot skip the data items which are out of the data processing pipeline because the data skipping technique can not know which data items are out of the data processing pipeline.\n","\n","Conclusion:\n","\"\"\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=1024,\n","                         temperature=0.7,\n","                         top_k=10,\n","                         top_p=0.9,\n","                         no_repeat_ngram_size=10,\n","                         early_stopping=True,\n","                         do_sample=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pPihABuTlXCT"},"source":["## paper 3"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GZ_OEwREmW1L"},"source":["## abstract and prompt experimentation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iSCtG2-MmT5A"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jKzguXvUlrRR"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 64\n","input_text = \"\"\"\n","Title: Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series\n","\n","Abstract:\"\"\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=512,\n","                         do_sample=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"v6h4ClWGl5jy"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 64\n","input_text = \"\"\"\n","Title: Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series\n","\n","# Abstract:\"\"\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=512,\n","                         do_sample=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"j6KytggCltVO"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 64\n","input_text = \"Title: Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=512,\n","                         do_sample=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"009RM59Em3L2"},"source":["## good abstract gen."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"EMO3DkiciMfv"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 64\n","input_text = \"Title: Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series\\n\\n\"\n","input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n","out = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=512,\n","                         do_sample=True)\n","print(tokenizer.decode(out[0]).lstrip('\u003cpad\u003e'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bDsvR0wplf9M"},"outputs":[],"source":["tokenizer.pad_token_id = 1\n","tokenizer.padding_side = 'left'\n","tokenizer.model_max_length = 512\n","input_text = \"\"\"\n","Title: Differentiable Divergences Between Time Series\n","\n","Abstract: Given a multivariate time series Y(t), we consider the problem of finding a time series approximation of the true unknown distribution pθ of Y.

In liquid xenon, the values of the Sellmeier coefficients, α(2.113 eV), α(10.6 eV), and α(8.075 eV), were measured by means of the Fabry-Perot method.
